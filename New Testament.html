              The parable of the servant who was forgiven of his debt of 10,000 talents, and then turned around and didn't forgive his own servant who only owed 100 pence. This parables meaing, at least what I think it is, is that our Lord will forgive all of our wrong doings to him, and he wants us to do the same, and if we don't we will be tormented. I also like how he said that how many times we should forgive someone is seventy times seven.
